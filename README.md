Welcome to my corner of the blockchain universe! 🌌

I am Thomilx, a dedicated self-validator. ⭐

My passion for blockchain technology runs deep, and I am committed to contributing to its decentralized future by setting up and maintaining nodes across various blockchain networks. 🔗

**My Journey**

My fascination with blockchain began with its promise of a decentralized, trustless world. 🌍 

As I delved deeper into the technology, I realized the critical role that nodes play in maintaining the integrity and security of blockchain networks. 🛡️ 

This realization led me to become a self-validator, where I could actively participate in and support the decentralized infrastructure. 🚀

**What I Do**
As a self-validator, my primary focus is on:
- Node Deployment and Management: Setting up and maintaining robust, secure nodes across multiple blockchain networks. 🖥️
- Blockchain Advocacy: Promoting the benefits of decentralization and educating others about the importance of running nodes. 📚
- Community Engagement: Participating in blockchain communities, sharing insights, and collaborating with other enthusiasts and developers to enhance the ecosystem. 🤝
